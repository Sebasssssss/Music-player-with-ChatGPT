## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

To use the application, you must create a `.env` file at the root level of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
REDIS_SECRET=your_redis_secret
```

You can obtain an OpenAI API key by signing up for an account on their website. For Redis, you can use a hosted service or run Redis locally.

To get the REDIS_URL and REDIS_SECRET, you will have to register on [upstash](https://console.upstash.com/) and create a new database.

Once the you've done all of that, you can interact with ChatGPT by typing in the chat input box. Ask for music recommendations based on genres, artists, or any other relevant queries. ChatGPT will process your query and provide you with personalized recommendations.
